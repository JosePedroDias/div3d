## utility constructors

*  90% cube (still lacking inverted option for sky boxes)
* 100% camera-aligned billboards (think flares, stars, etc.)
*  50% axis-aligned billboards (think trees)
*   0% cylinder
*   0% split quad for special effects


## camera abstractions

* 0% isometric / ortho (are these possible?)


## animation

* 0% easing functions
* 0% linear interpolation for floats, vectors, quaternions, colors

## samples:

* 50% soccer field
*  0% tennis court
*  0% wheel of fortune
*  0% coverflow
*  0% airport clock
*  0% environment map (cubemap application)


# sample challenges:

* soccer ball mapping of rotation -> 2D rendered sprite
* rubik's cube data structure
